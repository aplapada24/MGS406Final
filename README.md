# MGS406Final
MGS406 Final Project

This project is a simple application designed to serve as a customer database to track members of a store loyalty program, such as Wegmans shoppers club. It allows an employee to enter customer information, such as their name, phone number, as well as first and last purchase within the store. While very simple, this is a prototype product and could be expanded to contain more information within the mySQL database as well as additional functions within the application. 

Please view the requirements.txt file, as all of these packages are required to run this application. Prior to installing, run source venv/bin/activate to enter the virtual environment. 

Once in the virtual environment, please ensure that you have all of the listed packages from requirements.txt by running pip list and comparing your installed packages to those that I have listed. You may run the program from here, but Gunicorn is required if you wish to run the program off of an IP address. 

When using the application, you are greeted with three options: Add a customer, View the database, or exit the website (and be redirected to google). Feel free to explore, load the SQL database file, and add as you wish!
